# Namelist handling in deode
Describes the namelist handling in the Deode-Prototype.

## Internal usage
The deode namelists are stored as yml files and assembled following a set of rules.

## Get a specific namelist from command line
For a given configuration file any namelist generated by the system can be extracted from command line using e.g. for the forecast
```
deode show namelist -t master -n forecast_bdmodel_ifs
```
If you are uncertain about the name of the namelist you're searching for just type any name to get a list
```
deode show namelist -t master -n showme 
```
If you'd like have the namelist without the substituted values from the config file add a `-b` to the command. For more information about namelist extraction use the help command.
```
deode show namelist -h
```

## Add your own namelist

The simplest way to change a namelist is to extract it as described above, make your modifications and add the namelist to the directory specified by `platform.namelist in` the config file. The name of the namelist should be the same as when extracted above. Before the system will pick up your namelist you have to set `general.accept_stat_namelist = true` in the config file. Note that for the main forecast namelist any existing fullpos select files following the name convention "xxt\*" will be picked up as well if they exists. If not they will be generated.
